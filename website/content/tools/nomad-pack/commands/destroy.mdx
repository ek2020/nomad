# Nomad-Pack Destroy

Command: `nomad-pack destroy`

Delete an existing pack

@include "nomad-pack-commands/destroy_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `nomad-pack destroy <pack name> [options]`

Stop and delete the specified Nomad Pack from the configured Nomad cluster.
This is the same as using the command `nomad-pack stop <pack name> --purge`.

By default, the `destroy`` command will stop ALL jobs in the pack deployment.
If a pack was run using variable overrides to specify the job names, the same
variable overrides **MUST** be provided when stopping the pack to guarantee that
nomad-pack targets the correct jobs in the pack deployment.

### Examples

#### Stop an example pack in deployment "dev" and delete it from the cluster

```shell-session
nomad-pack destroy example --name=dev
```

#### Stop and delete an example pack in deployment "dev" that has a job named "test"

If the same pack has been installed in deployment "dev" but overriding the job
name to `hello`, only "test" will be deleted

```shell-session
nomad-pack destroy example --name=dev --var=job_name=test
```

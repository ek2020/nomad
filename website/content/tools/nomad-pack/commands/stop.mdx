# Nomad-Pack Stop

Command: `nomad-pack stop`

Stop a running pack

@include "nomad-pack-commands/stop_desc.mdx"

## Usage

Usage: `nomad-pack stop <pack name> [options]`

Stop the specified Nomad Pack in the configured Nomad cluster. To delete the
pack from the cluster, specify `--purge`, or use the `nomad-pack destroy`
command.

By default, the stop command will stop ALL jobs in the pack deployment. If a
pack was run using variable overrides to specify the job names, the same
variable overrides MUST be provided when stopping the pack to guarantee that
nomad-pack targets the correct jobs in the pack deployment.

## Examples

### Stop an example pack in deployment `dev`

```shell-session
nomad-pack stop example --name=dev
```

### Stop an example pack in deployment `dev` and purge it from the system

```shell-session
nomad-pack stop example --name=dev --purge
```

### Stop an example pack in deployment `dev` that has a job named `test`

If the same pack has been installed in deployment `dev` but overriding the
job name to `hello`, only `test` will be stopped

```shell-session
nomad-pack stop example --name=dev --var=job_name=test
```

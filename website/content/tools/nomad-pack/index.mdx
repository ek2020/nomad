# What is Nomad Pack

Nomad Pack is a templating and packaging tool used with HashiCorp Nomad.

Nomad Pack is used to:

- Easily deploy popular applications to Nomad
- Re-use common patterns across internal applications
- Find and share job specifications with the Nomad community

Nomad Pack can be thought of as a templating and deployment tool like Levant
with the ability to pull from remote registries and deploy multiple resources
together, like Helm.
